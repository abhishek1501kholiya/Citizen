# 🙋 Citizen Connect
It's a mobile app for connecting the citizens of a particular locality together and they can post stuff and see each other's post.  
# 💬 Description
This app is basically facebook for your neighborhood, so you can see posts from the people near you and share post.  
Made this as a fun project and Note: this project was created long ago so it might no longer work as expected.  
# 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack
I used react native for frontend
I used firebase for authentication and storing data  
# 📲 Usage
I don't know why you would be interested in a running a project so old but first you need to clone the repo and 
then follow these steps -   
  
Step 1:  
open the path of the repo in a terminal and run the following command  
```
npm install
```
Step 2:  
run the following command to start the development server 
```
expo start 
```
Now you will be able to test on the web, mobile or simulator.  
*for web*:    
press **w** key to open it on the web  
  
*for mobile*:    
you will need to install the **expo** app on app store or play store then scan the qr code on the terminal  
  
*for simulator*:  
press **i** to open it on the simulator  
  

Note: to run this project make sure to use your own firebase credentials in the /screens/config.js file otherwise it will not run and never share your firebase credentials like i did because i was kid and thought who cares?  

Thanks for taking out the time to check this repo  
Keep coding

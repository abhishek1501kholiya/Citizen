# Citizen Connect
It's a mobile app for connecting the citizens of a particular locality together and they can post stuff and see each other's post.  
# Description
This app is basically facebook for your neighborhood, so you can see posts from the people near you and share post.  
Made this as a fun project and Note: this project was created long ago so it might no longer work expectedly.  
# Tech Stack
I used react native for frontend
I used firebase for authentication and storing data  
# Usage

Step 1:

Now you will be able to test on the web, mobile or simulator.
